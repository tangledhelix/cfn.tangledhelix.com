&lt;&lt;&lt; OPEN LETTER FROM RAYMOND NEFF &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>Raymond Neff<br/>
Vice President for Information Services<br/>
Case Western Reserve University</p>

<p>This summary has been prepared in response to inquiries concerning the<br/>
Cleveland Freenet's efforts to serve the needs of its steadily increasing<br/>
number of users. It is not intended as an exhaustive or even complete history<br/>
of the Cleveland Free-Net.</p>

<p>Six Facts</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Cleveland Free-Net, developed at CWRU, is the pioneering initiative in<br/>
free public computing.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of the Cleveland Free-Net has grown rapidly: in 1994 there were<br/>
6 million user sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>CWRU has invested more than $300,000 in grants and other revenue to support<br/>
and improve the Cleveland Free-Net, and continues to spend more than<br/>
$50,000 annually to operate the system.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cleveland Free-Net has never charged a fee to a user, and it hopes<br/>
never to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cleveland Free-Net welcomes the arrival of commercial services, which<br/>
have begun to provide features similar to those available to Cleveland<br/>
Free-Net users for years.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cleveland Free-Net will remain an alternative to commercial services,<br/>
thus supporting open communication in our communities.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Background</p>

<p>The Cleveland Free-Net was born in 1986 as a research project in the Department<br/>
of Family Medicine at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine.<br/>
Assistant Professor Thomas M. Grundner was the principal investigator on the<br/>
project. As is standard operating procedure with university-based research<br/>
projects, he had the responsibility to seek funding for his research. Dr.<br/>
Grundner wrote proposals and eventually the University received funds and<br/>
computing equipment from a variety of sources to assemble the hardware and<br/>
software to create the Cleveland Free-Net. This fund raising effort raised<br/>
$44,000 from Ohio Bell, and computing equipment worth $60,000 from AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Free-Net system had its operational debut in July 1986. By summer<br/>
1988, the AT&amp;T hardware was overloaded with use (it had an absolute limit of<br/>
ten simultaneous users, but it regularly ran with a limit of nine). By this<br/>
time, the system had 1,000 registered users.</p>

<p>During 1987-88, plans were implemented to create a more functional version of<br/>
the Cleveland Free-Net software, to be dubbed Version 2. This project was<br/>
undertaken outside of CWRU by the newly created Society for Public Access<br/>
Computing (SoPAC). Dr. Grundner was the organization's first executive<br/>
director. SoPAC engaged a computer programmer and paid $10,000 to accomplish<br/>
this objective, using funds from a grant to SoPAC for this purpose. By summer<br/>
1989, no useful software had been developed, and the project was formally<br/>
abandoned.</p>

<p>Because CWRU attached great importance to the evolution of the Cleveland<br/>
Free-Net, it was decided that the University's newly created Office of<br/>
Information Services should be the home base for the Cleveland Free-Net. The<br/>
University Vice President for Information Services, Dr. Raymond K. Neff, took<br/>
on the overall responsibility for the operation and development of the<br/>
Cleveland Free-Net. As of July 1, 1989, Dr. Grundner and his staff of one<br/>
full-time support person became employees of CWRU's Office of Information<br/>
Services. The University took on the following objectives for improving the<br/>
system:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stabilizing the operation of the Cleveland Free-Net (during this period,<br/>
the computer hardware and modems had not had regular maintenance for over a<br/>
year and were unreliable).</p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing a computer which had the capacity to handle sixty simultaneous<br/>
users (the AT&amp;T computer was overloaded).</p></li>
<li><p>Adding more incoming telephone lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating the needed Version 2 Cleveland Free-Net software.</p></li>
<li><p>Putting a full complement of computer professionals into the operation<br/>
and maintenance of the system (providing operational support to the system<br/>
and its users 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 365 days per year -<br/>
which is the same basis as the University's mainframe computers).</p></li>
<li><p>Adding more services to the Cleveland Free-Net, most notably access to<br/>
the Internet and its vast array of information resources.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>By any measure, this program of improvements was a dramatic and substantial<br/>
commitment on the part of Case Western Reserve University to the still<br/>
experimental concept of free public computing.</p>

<p>Accomplishments</p>

<p>On August 16, 1989, the CWRU-developed version of the Cleveland Free-Net,<br/>
Version 2 went into public use. The six major objectives had been substantially<br/>
accomplished. The new Version 2, now registered by CWRU under the trademark<br/>
FreePort, had much more functionality than was called for in the design for the<br/>
earlier SoPAC-sponsored Version 2. This new system was based on new IBM<br/>
hardware which was far more powerful and reliable and had much more capacity<br/>
than the older AT&amp;T system. Twenty-four modems were added to the system,<br/>
bringing the total capacity in terms of number of simultaneous dial-in users<br/>
to 34.</p>

<p>Usage statistics took off. Within a few months, we had added 10,000 registered<br/>
users. That early pace has hardly slackened: as of this report, the number of<br/>
registered users exceeds 160,000. The operational usage statistics show<br/>
absolutely stunning growth factors when usage for calendar year 1994 is<br/>
compared to 1988: from 160 to 16,000 individual users on any given day; 36,000<br/>
to nearly 6 million user sessions per year (averaging 28 minutes each); and<br/>
sustained growth rates of over 10% per month!</p>

<p>FreePort was the first version of the Cleveland Free-Net software to be based<br/>
on a scalable architecture for hardware and software, whereas Cleveland<br/>
Free-Net Version 1 had definite limitations on growth. By its very design,<br/>
FreePort could grow to handle thousands of simultaneous users, as might be<br/>
envisioned in providing "commercial-grade" public access computing. In fact,<br/>
the original target for FreePort was 600 simultaneous users, clearly in another<br/>
ballpark from Cleveland Free-Net Version 1. Today, the Cleveland system<br/>
actually supports 406 simultaneous users, including connections through all<br/>
types of Internet service providers and 260 dial-in telephone lines.</p>

<p>The FreePort software and the know-how associated with this novel form of<br/>
computing were soon offered to other communities who wanted to emulate the<br/>
success of the Cleveland Free-Net. CWRU has helped over a dozen other cities<br/>
start clones of the Cleveland Free-Net. A grant of the FreePort software and an<br/>
IBM computer were given by CWRU to Medina County to start the Medina Free-Net.<br/>
This missionary work looked so promising in early 1990 that Dr. Grundner<br/>
started the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) as a project within<br/>
the Office for Information Services at CWRU, and after two years left CWRU to<br/>
devote full time to this concept. (NPTN has always been a separately<br/>
incorporated, not-for-profit entity.) To date, over 70 clones of the<br/>
Version 2 Cleveland Free-Net have been started.</p>

<p>Funding the Cleveland Free-Net Service</p>

<p>To anyone looking at the Cleveland Free-Net from a financial point-of-view, the<br/>
service has seemed somewhat magical. How can one offer millions of hours of<br/>
computer access time per year to thousands of people without charging them?</p>

<p>We have said for years that the service is free to its users, but there are<br/>
substantial costs in creating and operating the Cleveland Free-Net. Yes, the<br/>
Cleveland Free-Net is absolute free of charges to its end users, but the annual<br/>
costs of operating the Cleveland Free-Net are in the neighborhood of $50,000.<br/>
Without any external source of support for the system, these costs have fallen<br/>
on Case Western Reserve University. It is still true that, during the its<br/>
entire nine-year life, the Cleveland Free-Net has never charged a single user<br/>
for its service.</p>

<p>One of the possible funding models for the Cleveland Free-Net is public<br/>
broadcasting, i.e., we could use the fund-raising approach used very<br/>
successfully by PBS stations nationwide. After studying what is involved in<br/>
using this model, the University found that it did not have the in-house<br/>
expertise to carry out this approach. Over the years a few Cleveland Free-Net<br/>
users have said that they would volunteer to help raise funds for the Cleveland<br/>
Free-Net, but there have never been enough people to make the effort feasible<br/>
- although we deeply appreciate the sincerity and interest that these<br/>
volunteers showed in coming forward. A few other users have voluntarily sent<br/>
money to the University, but this source has never amounted to more than $1,000<br/>
per year.</p>

<p>Another possible funding model is the one used by public libraries. Our<br/>
excellent public library systems in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County do not charge<br/>
users for the general services they provide. They are funded in part with<br/>
a portion of the property taxes levied in the region, and they also receive<br/>
a share of a State of Ohio appropriation. Public access computing as practiced<br/>
by the Cleveland Free-Net is similar to the libraries' practice of making<br/>
general information resources available without charge, and it is interesting<br/>
that the Cleveland Free-Net model has been widely accepted by the community of<br/>
librarians. Perhaps the method that funds these libraries could be adapted to<br/>
cover the Cleveland Free-Net. On the other hand, it should be noted that there<br/>
have been several levies on area ballots in the past nine years to support<br/>
public libraries, and it is not clear that the voters would be in favor of<br/>
additional tax payments to support public access computing.</p>

<p>Over the past five years, the University has raised some $60,000, however, by<br/>
licensing the FreePort software to other communities to start clones of the<br/>
Cleveland Free-Net. All of these funds have been used to add more hardware to<br/>
the system, especially modems. Even so, growth in usage continues to outstrip<br/>
our best efforts.</p>

<p>One of the ways to offer free services is to control expenses. We have polished<br/>
our skills in this respect over the past seven years. In particular, the<br/>
hardware manufacturers have continued to give the University deep discounts on<br/>
their products, and this is very much appreciated. Even so, the University has<br/>
had to spend over $150,000 for computer hardware to implement three generations<br/>
of system upgrades, including the present Cleveland Free-Net service, which<br/>
involves 18 interconnected microcomputers (16 Intel Pentiums and 486s and two<br/>
Sun SparcServers), all running UNIX. Several thoughtful Cleveland Free-Net<br/>
users have made donations of used modems to the University, and these were put<br/>
into service. As one might expect with such equipment, it did not have a long<br/>
life, and the University eventually had to buy hundreds of replacement modems.<br/>
When we did make these purchases, we were careful to acquire "smart" modems<br/>
which provided superior reliability, very high speed (from 14400 baud to 38400<br/>
baud), and "intelligent" management. These modems were relatively expensive,<br/>
but they have been true workhorses.</p>

<p>From our usage statistics, we see that the Cleveland Free-Net modems are in use<br/>
over 99% of all available time (over 700 hours per month each). It is no<br/>
exaggeration to say that we could use double or even triple the number we<br/>
presently have. Lack of funding has been the principal limitation to continued<br/>
expansion of the Cleveland Free-Net.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the Cleveland Free-Net service now costs the University<br/>
under one penny per user session. Use of the public telephone system to connect<br/>
to the Cleveland Free-Net involves costs which add up to about four cents per<br/>
user session. Thus the total cost per user session when a telephone and modem<br/>
are used is now about five cents.</p>

<p>Connecting to the Cleveland Free-Net by way of the Internet is another<br/>
alternative, however. We started offering this approach in 1989, and now over<br/>
50% of all usage comes through this path. The cost of this linkage is less than<br/>
one tenth of a penny per session, so the lesson is clear: connecting to the<br/>
Cleveland Free-Net via the Internet is the most cost-effective method.</p>

<p>It is worth spending a moment to put these cost figures into perspective. If<br/>
the average Cleveland Free-Net user has two sessions per day via an Internet<br/>
connection, then our cost is $0.022. If the user does this every day for<br/>
a month, then the cost is $0.66 per month, the cost of two first class postage<br/>
stamps. On an annual basis, the cost is under $8.00. Given the costs to prepare<br/>
and send out invoices, we could not afford to bill our users for this service<br/>
- even if we wished to do so.</p>

<p>Looking Ahead</p>

<p>The Cleveland Free-Net represents a pioneering effort to provide free public<br/>
computing for this community and others nationally and internationally.<br/>
Commercial services, with access to risk capital and to fee income from large<br/>
numbers of corporate and individual users, are beginning to offer many of the<br/>
features that have been available to Free-Net users for years. The Cleveland<br/>
Free-Net does not plan to compete with these commercial services, but rather to<br/>
continue to offer no-fee public computing as an alternative for those who<br/>
cannot or choose not to become customers of commercial services, as well as for<br/>
users who choose to gain access to Free-Net through connections provided by<br/>
other services. In this respect, the Cleveland Free-Net preserves the<br/>
distinctly American tradition of open communication in a new era of information<br/>
technology.</p>
