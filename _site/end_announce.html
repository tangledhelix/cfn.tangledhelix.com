&lt;&lt;&lt; THE END OF CFN &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>In mid-1999, CWRU decided to discontinue the Cleveland Free-Net entirely.<br/>
This notice was posted to announce the impending shutdown.</p>

<pre><code>--------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>The Cleveland Free-Net, a remarkable achievement for its time, has been<br/>
made obsolete by new technologies. Chat and News services for community<br/>
users will end on September 1, 1999. The Free-Net will be discontinued on<br/>
September 30, 1999.</p>

<p>CWRU faculty, staff, and students should immediately investigate the services<br/>
provided by CWRUnet; information is available at Information Services Help<br/>
Desk (KSL 105A), via e-mail to help@po.cwru.edu, and on the World Wide Web<br/>
at www.cwru.edu/net/nutshell/miscl/free-cwru.html.</p>

<p>CWRU alumni should visit the Alumni Affairs World Wide Web site for<br/>
information about the CWRUser program at www.cwru.edu/development/alum2/.<br/>
That site gives an overview of the program, which is not an ISP but a way<br/>
to enhance alumni access to CWRU.</p>

<p>Community users of Free-Net should explore alternate ways of receiving e-mail<br/>
and using Internet resources. Public libraries, various continuing education<br/>
programs, city recreation boards, and community users' groups are excellent<br/>
sources of information.</p>

<pre><code>--------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>After September 30, 1999, users who attempted to log in were greeted with<br/>
this message:</p>

<p>"The Cleveland Freenet has discontinued operation. The project has<br/>
concluded. Thank you for your participation."</p>
