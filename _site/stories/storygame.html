<p>Once upon a time, in a sunny vale, on a sunny day, there was a guy named Danno.<br/>
He was a nice guy, with an evil woman at his side. Her name was Cindy. Little<br/>
did he realize that schemes were in operation which would be his downfall. He'd<br/>
made a grave error, you see, for he had stolen her cigarettes, and payment was<br/>
due.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our hero had no idea that he had offended the vengeful Cindy. He<br/>
believed that instead, that she was merely annoyed with his association with<br/>
the Wizard's Circle at b63062. It was this misunderstanding that would prove to<br/>
be poor Danno's downfall. While all his energy was diverted to hiding his<br/>
membership, Cindy had free reign to make her evil plans.</p>

<p>She clandestinely joined the rival Sorceror's Clan at b61784, and began<br/>
plotting, with the aid of her fellow magic-workers, the brutal piece-by-piece<br/>
destruction of Danno! However, she had forgotten the important alliance between<br/>
Danno and the Grand Wizard of Flame, Rih-Shah! She plotted her dark designs in<br/>
ignorance of this fact. Her ally in her efforts to destroy Danno, the Once<br/>
Renowned Jeffrey, Who Was Fallen, also didn't remember this, and so things went<br/>
on. One day, she got a pack of cigarettes in the mail, with the letter "D" on<br/>
the front and no return address.</p>

<p>Smirking with evil satisfaction, she tossed these in the trash. Her plan was<br/>
worth much more than a pack of cigs to her now. The first stage of her plan was<br/>
to discredit Danno though imposters and peculiar events surrounding him.<br/>
Jeffrey played a vital role in this, empowered by his ability to take on any<br/>
female semblance for a time.</p>

<p>Even with this formidable force, Cindy ran into a snag. During Halloween, the<br/>
night in which she was at her peak of power, she spied a bedraggled, grungy<br/>
figure in the night. She met this man, and knew his name only as Ryan...<br/>
instantly, her heart leapt out to him, without even realizing that he in fact<br/>
was the root of the power of b63062.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Head-Sorceror's Apprentice at b61784, known as ManO'Ice,<br/>
has deceptively snuck into his master Riccardo's dwelling area and begun to<br/>
leaf through some of the various pornographic periodicals... including his<br/>
favorite: "Hot Chicks of the Spirit World." He heard a faint mumbling and<br/>
cackling in the room next door... he finally recognized the voice as the<br/>
newcomer, Miss Cindy. He did not know much about her, but soon began to hear of<br/>
horrible plans to rip the emotional entrails from a certain jilted lover...<br/>
Danno!</p>

<p>But, as usual, the ManO'Ice had enirely misinterpreted the situation. Cindy in<br/>
fact was speaking of the jilted lover of Danno's, who was the lady Kristina.<br/>
For Cindy had always been jealous of the Lady Kristina, for she had always<br/>
wanted Danno all to herself, but could never manage to ensnare him in her web<br/>
of feminine wiles.</p>

<p>Failing that, she would now simply destroy him. Rumors began to spread, after<br/>
Jeffery's bizarre performances, so it was hardly questioned when one day Danno<br/>
vanished.</p>

<p>However, what many did not realize, was that Danno was not murdered, kidnapped,<br/>
castrated, or other such things by the evil Cindy. In fact, Danno was held<br/>
captive in a dark tower, by one known as Pyra, Mother of Pyro. Through the<br/>
majik of a powerful bracelet, inscribed with runes of hearts, she planned to<br/>
capture the heart of Kristina, and force the marriage of Pyro and Kristina, in<br/>
the far off land of PerDew.</p>

<p>ManO'Ice, upon hearing these plans from his Master's study, knew he could not<br/>
let this happen... for although he didn't give a rat's buttocks about Danno's<br/>
feelings, he secretly lusted after Kristina, and had even written odes and<br/>
ballads in her honors, for she was a woman of *true* surpassing beauty. So he<br/>
quickly zipped his pants back up, put away the pornos, and hopped on his white<br/>
stallion (OK, gray pack mule) and giddyeeapped his way over to Kristina's<br/>
dwelling place immediately to warn her.</p>

<p>Unknown to the rest of the heroic and/or evil people we've heard about so far,<br/>
the Lady Kristina was sitting in her bedroom, delicately fixing her hair for<br/>
yet another day in her personal Danno Shrine which was of course, where she<br/>
spent the majority of her free time, when she was not studying or practicing<br/>
her knitting. And so as the ManO'Ice came to her door, her mother politely told<br/>
him that Kristina was not available, and that he should come back another day.</p>

<p>Infuriated, ManO'Ice shouted, pounded on the walls, and spoke the forbidden<br/>
names in anger. The gods, on high Mt. Ayeness, looked down upon ManO'Ice with<br/>
displeasure and promptly ruptured his internal organs, leaving his still-<br/>
shuddering wreck dead at the scene. This, however intruded into Lady Pyra's<br/>
plans, as she tripped over ManO'Ice's remains, losing the bracelet in the<br/>
underbrush.</p>

<p>Infuriated at this mishap, she immediately resurrected ManO'Ice, and cast<br/>
a spell of command on him, forcing him to search the bushes for the majik<br/>
bracelet, until it was regained or until his death, whichever arrived first...<br/>
That being done, she smiled sweetly, and knocked on the door, asking for the<br/>
fair Kristina.</p>

<p>ManO'Ice, however, was stronger of mind and will than most gave him credit for.<br/>
He was, after all, an apprentice to a high sorceror of the Magic of Linux,<br/>
albeit a perverted one. He bravely pulled forth a potion from his almighty blue<br/>
PowerBook case, and swallowed it whole. Within seconds, ManO'Ice had<br/>
transformed into a snarling, hairy purple T-rex, and promptly *hugged* Pyra<br/>
into oblivion. (See what a little love can do?) This being done, shocking<br/>
Kristina's mother profusely... ManO'Ice swallowed another potion which returned<br/>
him to his former state and he calmly walked in, down into the dingy basement,<br/>
and back to Kristina's Danno Shrine where she was replacing the batteries in<br/>
her remote control, which she used to control the 25 foot screen depictor of<br/>
Danno footage, that she played on a daily basis while in a semi-hypnotic opiate<br/>
state. When she saw the ManO'Ice barge in, she quickly switched off the lights<br/>
and vanished down a trap door in the floor, expertly concealed by a large rug<br/>
with Danno's face emblazoned on it.</p>

<p>A labyrinthine system of tunnels provided Kristina her escape. Swinging closed<br/>
the panel back into the Denny's wall, she slipped out into the crowds.</p>

<p>After enjoying several coffees, Kristina decided that she needed to freshen up.<br/>
As she closed the door in one of the stalls, she heard a light tap tap tapping,<br/>
and faint cries of "HELP HELP HELP, AND FOR GOD SAKES, DON'T FLUSH AGAIN!"<br/>
Searching the wall, revealed a small passage down to a small antechamber, in<br/>
which she saw her master, Danno, chained to the wall, directly under a rather<br/>
largish spout.</p>

<p>Seeing her Danno chained to the wall was almost too much for her... for she was<br/>
so horny from thinking about him for 24 hours a day for *so* long, she could do<br/>
nothing but tear the clothes off his body and pounce on him. Once her wild<br/>
sexual urges were fulfilled, she released him from his chains.</p>

<p>And a good thing he was now free, for at that very moment, who should choose to<br/>
flush themselves down that very Denny's toilet but Jeffrey and the evil Cindy.<br/>
Instantly, Cindy went to cast a vexation spell on the wretched Danno, to make<br/>
his underwear itch 'til the day he died, when Kristina jumped in the way and<br/>
got the full impact of the blast of energy that had leapt from the little Red<br/>
Riding Hood wanna-be's fingertips.</p>

<p>Kristina would bear this affliction with noble dignity for weeks before Cindy's<br/>
counterpart Ryan took pity on her, breaking the spell. Cindy scowled at her<br/>
obstruction and struck again, this time relying on trusty cold steel. A wicked<br/>
dagger leapt from her hand as though possessed of its own malicious will (which<br/>
it happened to be), diving straight for Danno.</p>

<p>Danno was known to be fast, but not that fast. The dagger plunged deep into<br/>
Danno's heart. So deep in fact, it made sparks on the wall as it passed through<br/>
the other side. The high concentration of methane in the room exploded into<br/>
huge fireball, charring everyone to a crisp, except: As the fire ball erupted,<br/>
an amazing thing happened. Time slowed to a crawl, as ManO'Ice's one true wish<br/>
came true: To give his life in an attempt to save Kristina's. Using the<br/>
slowtime spell, he was able to push Kristina away from the fire. However, he<br/>
was not fast enough to save himself. He died a most horrible stinky flaming<br/>
death. And so, Ryan being the only remaining male in the tale, became<br/>
Kristina's lover, all because of his newly grown goatee.</p>
