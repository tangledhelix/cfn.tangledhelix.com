&lt;&lt;&lt; A TALE OF TWO MIDGETS &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were two midgets. The first midget was a real arrogant<br/>
kind of guy, the sort of obnoxious snot you'd see in a mob movie as a tough,<br/>
take-no-crap, I'll blow your head off kinda guy. This means of course that he<br/>
spent most of his time at home reading Better Homes and Gardens in the privacy<br/>
of his bathroom, lest anyone discover his horrible secret. The other midget was<br/>
a mousy, docile, feminine sort of guy. This means he owned a large amount of<br/>
firearms, and could take out a human being with a single shot from a hundred<br/>
yards, and he ate only Manwiches, never ever eating Tofu or Yogurt in his<br/>
entire life. But today we'll just deal with their public images, and leave<br/>
their home life secrets alone.</p>

<p>The two midgets both worked in a toy store, whose warped policy, written by<br/>
someone at the headquarters 500 miles away, stated that they had to hire<br/>
midgets if at all available, and pay them double rates since they were only<br/>
half as tall, and besides, who better to work in a toy store but a damn midget?<br/>
They could relate to the rest of the world's vertically challenged people,<br/>
commonly known as children. So it was that day in and day out these midgets had<br/>
to abase and humiliate themselves before whiny, screaming little kids for their<br/>
amusement and all that. But, it paid well.</p>

<p>But one day, the feminine little midget decided he was going to quit, for he<br/>
had found a much better job elsewhere, and his last act of retaliation was<br/>
going to be to bring one of his really big big guns into the toy store and just<br/>
wipe the entire place out, and then of course, take off and change his name and<br/>
get lots of plastic surgery. After all, that was how he had escaped from being<br/>
prosecuted for shooting Kennedy all those years ago. Who ever suspected<br/>
a midget of murder? Sha.</p>

<p>So he went home and oiled up a rapid-fire assault rifle and got a few hundred<br/>
rounds of ammo, and snuck it in (god knows how) to the stock room of the toy<br/>
store, and up to those little observation windows they have to make sure you<br/>
don't steal toys. He put a silencer on his rifle (hard to find one of those,<br/>
lemme tell you), took the pane of two-way glass out, and one by one picked off<br/>
pretty much everyone in the store. He did, however, manage to miss the other<br/>
midget, who was his primary target in the first place, for the other midget was<br/>
hiding in a pile of stuffed animals (ala E.T.) and was quite effectively<br/>
camouflaged inside their fuzzy depths.</p>

<p>So, the other midget eventually got bored and went home.</p>
