<p>What is b63062?</p>

<p>b63062 or b63062.STUDENT.CWRU.Edu, as it is officially known, is the official<br/>
site of a paramilitary organization bent on the destruction of the world<br/>
through the Internet. Disguised as a average 486/33 running Linux, the machine<br/>
is in reality a Cray supercomputer with a power greater than any known computer<br/>
in existence. Bootups are often accompanied by a brownout in the surrounding<br/>
areas. In addition, anti-aircraft missle banks and nuclear missile silos are<br/>
rumoured to be hidden around the campus in preparation for the Internet<br/>
Revolution.</p>

<p>Who has accounts on this machine, and why?</p>

<p>The users on this machine all have a wide background in the espionage and<br/>
terrorist fields. Many also have experience in computer programming. Using this<br/>
combination, we will taking over the world in short order, starting with the<br/>
Cleveland Freenet.</p>

<p>The leader of this band of revolutionaries is Ryan "killall -9 tcsh" K.<br/>
Deported from France in the early seventies for trafficking arms to school<br/>
children that felt their grades were unfair, R.K. has set up shop in the United<br/>
States, working on his master plan of electronic warfare. Rumour has is that<br/>
R.K. is responsible for any crash that happens anywhere.</p>

<p>Can I have an account?</p>

<p>No. Unless you have a very large machine gun, knowledge of explosives, and<br/>
enjoy killing people with extreme amounts of electricity. You also have to pass<br/>
a 500 page written test, and oral exam, and kill a member of INS using only<br/>
a jumper from Cabletron e21xx card. As you can see, it is not an easy thing<br/>
to do.</p>

<p>Why was b63062 banned from IRC?</p>

<p>Because a certain person's fear of the ominous power of b63062 overcame him,<br/>
and caused him to defect to the dark side. It is an unfortunate thing, but<br/>
preparations have been made for a small tactical nuke to be placed in his<br/>
refrigerator. We apologize for any fallout that may cause your friends and/or<br/>
neighbors and inconvience.</p>

<p>Is this true?</p>

<p>Yes. Scary huh? If it wasn't for the courageous members of the almighty<br/>
guardians of the world, we may have taken over the entire Freenet and the<br/>
entire Internet and made everyone eat scads of nasty food.</p>
