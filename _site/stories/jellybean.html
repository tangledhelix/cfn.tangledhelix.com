&lt;&lt;&lt; THE MAGIC JELLYBEAN &gt;&gt;&gt;

<p>Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jennifer. She was rumored to have been<br/>
six months old before she even came into existence, and for this reason, all<br/>
the people of the land were jealous of her because she was therefore a magical<br/>
person. The King (who was single!) took notice of her one day, and was inspired<br/>
by this magical creature, which lived in his kingdom, so he gave unto her the<br/>
most special gift a king in that land might give, which was a jellybean. Not<br/>
just any jellybean. A wishing jellybean!  She could rub the jellybean, and<br/>
a little bean-genie would come out, and grant her one wish, provided she ate<br/>
the jellybean afterward and set him free. For so long as the jellybean existed<br/>
he was forever its prisoner, and it gets awfully cramped up in a jellybean for<br/>
someone as big as a genie (especially a bean-genie, who were rather large, as<br/>
genies go), so she kept the genie-bean in her pillow until she could think of<br/>
a wish special enough to use it for. But she was yet a young girl, and prone to<br/>
distraction, and soon forgot the jellybean in favor of a young man named<br/>
Michael, who caught her eye one day. The poor little bean-genie grew anxious as<br/>
he realized he might well spend years more locked in his jellybean prison<br/>
whilst this girl went about her dalliances with Michael, and he grew sad, but<br/>
it was only a handful of years, the genie was relieved to see (for what is such<br/>
a short time to a bean-genie?) before she came to her pillow one day and<br/>
reached in to grasp his little world and rub upon its sides and as he came<br/>
forth, she asked of him to make her into the most beautiful woman in all the<br/>
world, so that Michael would wish to marry her. The genie chuckled inwardly,<br/>
and in a minute, I'm sure you'll see why. For he waved forth his great arm and<br/>
a ray of light fell upon her and a moment later, the genie tossed the jellybean<br/>
in her mouth, and she dutifully chewed it up, and swallowed it, setting the<br/>
genie free. Almost as an afterthought she walked to a mirror, only to see the<br/>
same face she had seen every day for years on end. She angrily turned to the<br/>
genie and demaded to know what the meaning of this was, when he chuckled<br/>
*outwardly* this time he said unto her:</p>

<p>"Silly girl, you asked of me to make you into that which you already are! You<br/>
are a magic creature, and really, there wasn't much I could improve
on."</p>

<p>She blushed, and the genie went on a vacation in Tahiti. The moral of the story<br/>
is: only wish for things you don't already have. Genies are tricky.</p>
