&lt;&lt;&lt; THE MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>

<p>So it is time once again.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a time just long enough ago for this story to be current, but<br/>
not long enough ago for it to be really all that current, there lived a man in<br/>
the mountains, and his name was Ryan.</p>

<p>Now, Ryan was a really nice sort of man, the kind you don't often find in<br/>
a world of not-so-nice sorts of men, and that's exactly why he lived in the<br/>
mountains, far away from all the people who would try to change him and make<br/>
him not-so-nice. And he was happy.</p>

<p>And if you ever needed anything, a cup of sugar, a stick of butter, a bucket of<br/>
milk, why, you could just trek on up that mountain, and if you could catch Ryan<br/>
at home, why, he was just so nice, that he would give it to you, and never<br/>
expect anything in return. He was that kind of guy. In fact, if you made the<br/>
trek all the way up the mountain, and found that Ryan actually wasn't at home,<br/>
then all you had to do was take whatever you wanted, and leave a note on the<br/>
table saying you'd been there and borrowed some milk or butter or whatnot, and<br/>
Ryan didn't mind one bit. Not one bit at all. He really was a very nice guy.</p>

<p>Well, he used to be, anyway.</p>

<p>See, after a while that nasty human gossip machine had everyone in the county<br/>
knowing that Ryan was there to just give you milk and butter whenever you<br/>
wanted! So of course there were those people who would trek on up the mountain,<br/>
and ask him for a stick of butter every single day! That's right, they never<br/>
bought a stick of butter for themselves at all anymore, they just leeched off<br/>
of Ryan's butter, and off of Ryan's milk, and off of Ryan's sugar, until<br/>
finally we see that Ryan has no more butter, and no more sugar, and no more<br/>
milk, except that amount which he absolutely did need for himself, and of<br/>
course he can't very well give that away. And so he didn't.</p>

<p>So then it was that Ryan decided that he couldn't afford to feed an entire<br/>
county anymore, and for the first time in his life, he went to the blacksmith,<br/>
and he asked for him to fashion a lock to put upon his door, and lo and behold,<br/>
to this very day, if you trek up on the mountain, to ask Ryan for a stick of<br/>
butter, why, there's a fence, and a nasty dog to keep you away, and even if you<br/>
manage to get by both of them, you're greeted by a heavy locked steel door, and<br/>
barred windows, and Ryan sitting inside crying to himself, for the world made<br/>
him what he most despised: a not-so-nice guy.</p>

<p>How sad.</p>
