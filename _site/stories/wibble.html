&lt;&lt;&lt; THE TALE OF WIBBLE &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>

by Shadowfax
</p>

<p>"Chardonnay, please," said the young man at the table. He had a laptop terminal<br/>
at his side, next to a plate with a sandwich on it, which he kept flipping over<br/>
and examining minutely. He was a regular here at the Caf&eacute; Cybernaut, but then<br/>
again he was also the owner and founder, so that was not so unusual, really. At<br/>
a nearby table, all his female suitors were sitting adjusting their makeup and<br/>
undergarments so that they might impress him if he looked their way. He never<br/>
did; he paid other people to do that. He didn't have time for such silliness...<br/>
reading alt.food.recipes took up enough of his already far too valuable time.<br/>
And so the little minxes wasted all their efforts to get their grab at the<br/>
famous Worm King of San Francisco.</p>

<p>I think it's about time I told you a little bit about our dear friend Wibble,<br/>
or the Worm King, as he is popularly known. You see, in about 1998 or so, the<br/>
fishing market was getting itself into trouble, as there was a horrible<br/>
shortage of bait (that being most popularly worms, of course), and in fact many<br/>
families starved to death due to the fish shortage. But one young pioneering<br/>
scientist had come up with an idea (philosophers and historians will argue that<br/>
a mega-dose of steroids actually gave him the ability to think of this idea,<br/>
however, that will be a debate until the end of time and I won't go into it<br/>
here), and what he did is he created something which he "based on the Star Trek<br/>
Universal Translator, only it talks only to worms."</p>

<p>In essence, he created a tiny black box with a microphone, a speaker, and<br/>
a button, and it let you talk to worms. So all he did is sold it to a bunch of<br/>
con-men for a healthy price, and they went about their work conning worms out<br/>
of their little hiding places and the fish market was booming again. Soon<br/>
Wibble was known across the world, and WibbleCo was a household word across the<br/>
globe. Tykes in Tokyo, Beijing, and Atlanta alike played with toy WibbleCo<br/>
trucks and rubber worms. Meanwhile, in his private jet, Wibble himself tooled<br/>
about the world finding sandwiches and cricket farms, and in fact pioneered the<br/>
Juerrgen Olivski Cricket Mating Research Center in Helsinki, although he denies<br/>
it to this day.</p>

<p>But, I digress.</p>

<p>The reason we find the great golden-haired Wibble in his restaurant this day is<br/>
that he has picked one of the starry-eyed little starlets from his surrounding<br/>
tables to mingle with. You'd not believe me if I told you that this is<br/>
something people can and have been murdered over.</p>

<p>As he saw her out of the corner of his eye, approaching the table, he flipped<br/>
his sandwich suavely. She nearly swooned. She managed, barely, to sit in the<br/>
chair the waiter had pulled out for her, and gazed longingly into her<br/>
dream-man's eyes.</p>

<p>Minutes passed. She didn't mind.</p>

<p>He had finished eating his sandwich in fact (not a short process, let me tell<br/>
you) before he deemed her coherent enough to chat with.</p>

<p>"So then, what is your name, anyway?" asked he, having forgotten that minor<br/>
detail already.</p>

<p>She looked shocked that he would even care. For a moment she looked as if she<br/>
couldn't even remember it herself before she managed a dazed, "Karen. But you<br/>
can call me Slave."</p>

<p>"Fine, slave. Would you care for a half-glass of wine? I'm afraid I can't<br/>
finish it." She raised the glass to her lips in a kind of worship.</p>

<p>He merely smiled and plotted for later in the evening.</p>

<p>The limousine cruised silently through the city streets under the harvest moon,<br/>
carrying the famous Worm King and the woman he had ensnared on his hook this<br/>
night. He liked to watch them wriggle and struggle before he finished them off<br/>
at the end of the night. But we won't get into that until later if you don't<br/>
mind.</p>

<p>He liked to play games, too.</p>

<p>"If I were to ask you to take your dress off, would you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Well, sure, I guess," she replied. He snorted.</p>

<p>"Please do so."</p>

<p>She wriggled rather too efficiently out of the dress, which disappointed him in<br/>
a way, but he gathered the result was quite the same.</p>

<p>"And your undergarments of course as well."</p>

<p>So she (too) swiftly flung them off as well.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your jewelry."</p>

<p>Off it came.</p>

<p>He had however by this time gotten quite bored with this rather pitiful and<br/>
predictable creature, and told his chauffer, the ever trusty Roger, to pull<br/>
over to the side and remove the young lady from the vehicle, after injecting<br/>
her with the usual memory erasing drug he kept a stock of in the glove<br/>
compartment. So it was that the papers reported another in a string of<br/>
unclothed women wandering the city not remembering what they had been doing the<br/>
night before.</p>

<p>As they drove away, Wibble got into the front seat with Roger, and sighed. "Why<br/>
do they always bore me so, my friend?"</p>

<p>Roger could only sit in awe of his employer, and said "Well, sir, if they bore<br/>
you, I'm sure I could find a way to entertain them at least for a little<br/>
while."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear lad. Be happy with the magazines I bought you. Now, now, then,<br/>
I need someone who will give me more of a challenge than these shaven<br/>
chimpanzees I keep ending up with. Do let Shad know and have him get on the<br/>
hunt right away..."</p>

<p>So it was that the already overworked research director, Shad, now had this<br/>
additional task to do, and so in vengeance, he rigged the computers so that the<br/>
boss got what he wanted in such a way so that he'd regret it...</p>

<p>In fact, it was only the very next week that the system returned the answer it<br/>
had been hunting for for an entire seven days (which is an awfully long time<br/>
for a computer to take to do *anything* if it's not run by Case Western Reserve<br/>
University!), and that answer was the address and phone number and a photo-<br/>
graphic image of a girl by the name of Kristen, far away in the state of Ohio.<br/>
So a team of mercenaries was dispatched to retrieve her to Wibble, and in the<br/>
middle of the night, amidst random screams and protests, she was abducted and<br/>
shoved into a rather smelly black van with California license plates. Even the<br/>
trained mercenaries didn't see the little face of her neighbor Harold poking<br/>
out his window with a pen and paper to jot down their plates, (he had been<br/>
watching her undress for bed) but he won't matter until much much much later,<br/>
and so we won't bother about that just yet.</p>

<p>So it was that after the chloroform wore off a bit, we find Kristen tied hand<br/>
and foot in the back of that rather odoriferous vehicle with a bunch of dirty<br/>
sweaty men. Normally one of Wibble's targets might have enjoyed this scenario,<br/>
but remember this one had been selected due to being quite different from the<br/>
rest of them. In fact, we are about to see such a story that you had best go<br/>
get some refreshments and use the restroom *now* as I'm sure you won't want to<br/>
tear yourself away later on. Now, then, let's go on with my grand tale.</p>

<p>Wibble in fact was awaiting her now enroute to Paris, and they dropped her off<br/>
in an in-air docking procedure which only truly insane pilots might try to<br/>
attempt, but then, Wibble was careful to only hire people of a less stable<br/>
mentality than himself. Roger and Shad were true examples of this. In any case,<br/>
he usually ended up with women of a much lower mental standing as he as well,<br/>
but no no, Shad had taken care of that. Wibble knew as soon as they dumped her<br/>
onto the plane that he had perhaps bitten off more than he could chew in this<br/>
case. Roger just stared. Shad chuckled quite quietly at his work. The pilot<br/>
almost crashed, before saying "Ow Cindy I wasnt staring at her butt!" He went<br/>
back to squinting out the front window of the plane trying to figure out which<br/>
way to go. The little red-haired girl seated next to him put her club away and<br/>
went back to watching him.</p>

<p>Randomly we heard another "Ow" or five at different times from the pilot's<br/>
cabin, followed each time by something along the lines of "Hey, I wasn't<br/>
looking at her!" or "Hey, I didn't let him see me naked!" or even the cryptic<br/>
"Hey, I didn't touch your lipstick, that was Heather's!" That last unstrategic<br/>
one earned him yet another strike from the club. (I wanted to get those out of<br/>
the way now so I don't have to bother you with them all later on.)</p>

<p>But, on with the story.</p>

<p>Kristen picked herself up off the floor, and dusted off her wrinkled nightgown<br/>
(for of course that's what she'd been wearing at the time), and looked straight<br/>
at the famous Wibble, who she had never heard of, Ohio not being a large<br/>
fishing state. He asked her his usual question, that being the one about taking<br/>
off all your clothes, underwear, and jewelry at his bidding, and she said<br/>
something like "Sha right, rich boy." He perked up then at this, and for the<br/>
first time in years, he smelled that which he had so long ago forgotten the<br/>
pleasure of: *challenge*.</p>

<p>The cabin grew quiet as the crew slowly realized the import of what was<br/>
happening in front of them. One by one they wandered off to their own cabins<br/>
and left the master to his work. Roger of course assumed his position in the<br/>
bathroom next to his cleverly concealed peephole, and the pilot switched on the<br/>
video surveillance system as per usual order. But this time they all sensed<br/>
they were witnessing history in the making.</p>

<p>As soon as they were alone in the cabin, the two looked each other up and down.</p>

<p>In the mind of Wibble we see what he finds to be the most attractive woman he's<br/>
ever met... someone who won't bend to his will like Gumby, who in fact has no<br/>
idea who he is. He gazed up and down (repeatedly if you must know) and thanked<br/>
God or Shad or whoever applied to the gratitude.</p>

<p>In the mind of Kristen we see that she really just sees a wimpy, scrawny little<br/>
brat with a lot of money and altogether too bad an attitude for his own good.<br/>
In fact, she'd rather have the chauffer than this overblown Rockefeller<br/>
wannabe. But she wasn't going to let the chauffer know that, if you know what<br/>
I mean.</p>

<p>Wibble picked up the small remote control that he always kept somewhere near<br/>
him and pushed a smallish button in the corner of it. The doors at either end<br/>
of the cabin slid shut and they were locked inside this little room, fifty<br/>
thousand feet in the air, with a fleet of in-flight refueling jets at this<br/>
man's disposal. Theoretically, they could fly forever and not have to land<br/>
until one of the engines exploded. Or something like that.</p>

<p>Kristen sat down across from this brat prince and did something no one had done<br/>
in as long as he could remember. She reached across, took his little remote<br/>
control, and unceremoniously threw it out a window she managed to wrench open<br/>
a little.</p>

<p>Needless to say, our little kingpin was quite shocked. He dropped to his knees<br/>
and proposed on the spot. This time she opened the window all the way and<br/>
instead of tossing the remote out, she tossed *him* out.</p>

<p>Luckily for her (and him) he had a compact-o-chute on under his smoking jacket,<br/>
which he calmly opened on a count of ten. He landed in the Indian Ocean, on the<br/>
upper deck of a large aircraft carrier which had been redirected in the search<br/>
for more worms. It bore his insignia on the side, crudely covering the original<br/>
insignia of the now defunct U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>Once they got him safely back to California, he found Kristen sitting in his<br/>
office at home, awaiting him. She said that she would marry him under the<br/>
condition that he destroy all the WibbleTalks in the world, and did it soon.<br/>
But why? he asked. That was really all he had... without the WibbleTalk, he had<br/>
nothing, and was nothing. She said, just do it.</p>

<p>So, god help him, he did. It took him only 3 days actually, to systematically<br/>
find and destroy every registered WibbleTalk in the world, and then to destroy<br/>
the original plans which he kept in his safe. He asked again of her, why he had<br/>
to do this?</p>

<p>"Well, I like fish... but I don't like to eat them, I just want them to live<br/>
a happy life. Also, I'd only marry you if you were willing to give up your<br/>
kingdom *for* me, not give it up *to* me..."</p>

<p>That didn't make a bit of sense to him, but he thought she was cute so he<br/>
married her anyway.</p>
