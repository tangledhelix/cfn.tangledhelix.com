&lt;&lt;&lt; THE RUBBER BALL PARADIGM &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>

by Taishan
</p>

<p>Existence is as a Rubber Ball.</p>

<p>It can be bouncy bouncy fun fun fun, but when you chase it under the furniture<br/>
without thinking, you get dustbunnies stuck to your sweater. Eventually, this<br/>
existence is covered with ashes and cola stains, and is relegated to the<br/>
landfill.</p>

<p>Basic Tenets of the Rubber Ball Paradigm</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Never do Easily what can be done With Difficulty, if for nothing else than<br/>
to make things More Interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>If its not Fun, then it is Work.</p></li>
<li><p>The Power to Bounce lies within: seeking it without is Too Much Work, and<br/>
that's No Fun.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from the Rubber Ball, Material Objects are Not Sacred.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean beneath the Bed and the Couch once in awhile, because you never know<br/>
when you might Bounce Under There.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize Living as Majesty, rather than Burden.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize Death as Passage, rather than Ending.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize Too Much Bouncing as An Annoyance.</p></li>
<li><p>The Pinnacle is a collection of foods, friends, warmth and music,<br/>
experienced simultaneously. Bounce there Often.</p></li>
</ol>
