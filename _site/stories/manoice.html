&lt;&lt;&lt; THE MAN O' ICE &gt;&gt;&gt;

<p>There was once a man, thought to be made of ice, called, of course, Man'O'Ice.<br/>
Now, you might think to yourself that his name arose from the fact that he was<br/>
cold and heartless. On the contrary, he was warm, and seemingly had a heart big<br/>
enough for two people. The name arose from the fact the a woman's touch, or<br/>
rather grope, would melt him into a babbling puddle of stagnant water. For in<br/>
all actuality, this poor boy was a sadomasochist, and he loved nothing more<br/>
than sharing this with the entire world. And so, everyday, like clockwork, this<br/>
poor boy, whom for brevity we will call Rog from now on, would walk to the<br/>
local tree and post messages of his recents tragedies. In fact, as his life<br/>
seemed to be as long and tragic as the Odyssey, the artful Rog's work soon<br/>
occupied the entire forest. Because of the sudden decline in the lumber<br/>
industry, he was soon banished to the the land of Columbus. And so, the artful<br/>
dodger was reduced to a tragic poet from afar, singing his love, the Roxette<br/>
way, the true way, to Katie. Except on Tuesdays, when he attempted to seduce<br/>
Michaele. And Thurdays, when he harassed Kristen. And of course, Saturdays,<br/>
when Mr. Wenk and Rog would tussle over various things. But otherwise, he was<br/>
totally devoted. Miss Katie could fuck dogs in the middle of Sunday Mass for<br/>
all he cared. He would still love her, and she would always be his, even though<br/>
they had broken up several decades earlier. Even the power of the law wouldn't<br/>
stop him. Restraining order? Merely a nuisance. Guard dogs? Simply cute puppies<br/>
in his eyes of longing and lust. And so Roger died alone, his last muttering<br/>
a simple one.</p>
