<pre>yeah, i was going through old stuff and trying to
get rid of things.  i've been trying to avoid
being a packrat like my mom.  anyways, i threw
out a ton of pics thinking &quot;oh, yeah this person
 from irc, i'll never see them again.&quot;  even
michaele's picture (i'm sorry, it's true!)  i
know cindy rizi, ashlee mclaughlin, and sherrie
nyugen were in that bunch too.  damn damn damn.

well, hell, i'm really glad to see we're all
getting back together again.  i still have some
lasting relationships with folks from irc
(amadeus who now lives out here and builds wheels
at the bike manufacturer i work for and rolvow
who still lives with his parents despite being
married, having travelled the world, and thinking
about crossing the atlantic on a tandem kayak)
and often find myself missing it.  instant
msg'ing doesn't cut it and no irc has the same
feel cfn did.

can someone PLEASE e-mail
(roulez-libre@animail.net) me a list of the
people they need/want to get a hold of?  i know a
few of them on the last list i can take care of.
 i was in contact with shannon blake (shag) a
while back.  i can probably find her again.  

i really vote for a picnic but let's get the hell
out of cleveland.  i'm so glad i got out of that
cesspool it's not even funny!  oregon at least
starts with an o.  no, olklahoma doesn't count. 
it's technically pronounced &quot;auh-kluh-homey.&quot;

but all seriousness aside, let me catch you all up:

i am/was walter lapchynski or sasha i nyktos /
TriXteR, nyghtmeyr, silence, and a bunch of other
nicks i can't even keep track of / at128 or fv075
(both respective to my real name and my nomme de
plume).  i was the guy who (with a little help)
handcuffed sati and sat on top of her at a picnic
many moons ago.  HAHAH!!  god i can't believe i'm
remembering all this shit.

my story goes a little like this:  i did nothing.
 just acted like the usual freak i still am to
various degrees until rolvow came back from
europe and taunted me with good stories.  he made
me promise i'd go with him next time he went some
where.  and i did.  we went to san fran to see
crash worship (who is unfortunately defunkt but
we saw every year after the 1st time we saw them
because it was such a religious experience) and i
fell in love with the west coast.  he got the
idea of hiking the pacific crest trail and i came
along with.  we had some hiking partners (one of
which was his gf) who werent' experienced enuff
and so we ended up getting off.  we split ways
and i ended up going to portland oregon where my
wife was (we had met her along the way which is a
much longer story full of amazing coincidences)..
i spent some time homeless, we hooked up, went to
hawai'i where we bummed around on the beach for
months on end at punalu'u and got engaged in
manoa.  then we came back and settled on
eugene... until my dad offered me a free house in
cleveland (another long story) which we took but
living in slavic village was kinda lame.  i spent
some time starting school (i finally figured out
what i wanted to do among all the millions of
things i was interested in) by doing community
college whilst being a bike messenger downtown. 
by now the bike addiction was rampant, so when we
returned (i dragged amadeus back who was the guy
who introduced me to being a messenger there) i
had to find a job around bikes.  i got lucky as a
bike manufacturer (www.bikefriday.com) was
hiring.  i've done a little bit of everything
here and built a shitload of bikes for myself. 
we were even car free for a bit but our house
(yes we bought a little fixer uper that's now got
a brand new house on the property) is kinda too
far out for my wife and daughter.  so now we have
a little kia spectra.  i still ride my bike
everyday.  i'm two (this one and the next) terms
away from my bachelors in science.  should have
an honors degree and a dissertation to show for
it, specifically on a gene (dim-6) involved in
DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa (french
bread yeast).  then maybe a job, but prolly grad
school.  just visited UCLA and applied to a few
others in cali, hawaii, and uoregon (where i've
been doing all my gen science and bio studies
at).  so i dunno what the next step is, but i'm
having fun and loving life.

phew.

i think that's it.

in other news, dan:  i can't believe you're
working for the feds.

we need to get some more people on this list. 
and we all need to hook up on irc again.  i
wonder if we can still manage to remember what
cliques we belong in. :)
