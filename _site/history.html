&lt;&lt;&lt; HISTORY &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>In 1984, Dr. Tom Grundner and others at the
<a href="http://www.cwru.edu/">Case Western Reserve University</a><br/>
School of Medicine created a free medical bulletin board system designed to<br/>
connect people with healthcare professionals. They named it St. Silicon's<br/>
Hospital. Anybody with a computer and a modem could post questions free of<br/>
charge and medical staff at CWRU would answer them.</p>

<p>When St. Silicon's Hospital proved to be a success, Dr. Grundner decided to<br/>
expand the system; the virtual hospital grew into a virtual city. By 1986,<br/>
St. Silicon's Hospital had evolved into the much larger Cleveland Free-Net. As<br/>
with St. Silicon's, anybody with a computer and a modem was free to log in.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Free-Net system was built on top of proprietary software<br/>
developed by the staff at CWRU. It was called FreePort, and was available for<br/>
any institution to use for the fee of US$1. Many others picked up on the<br/>
Free-Net idea and before long Free-Nets were popping up all over the place. The<br/>
second Free-Net to come online was the Youngstown Free-Net (YFN), also in Ohio.<br/>
Many others followed suit; I have personally logged into Free-Nets in places as<br/>
far away as Finland!</p>

<p>Due to its restrictive nature, CFN was closer to being a BBS than it was to<br/>
being an Internet provider. About the only thing that connected you to the<br/>
Internet proper was Usenet and email. The SIGs (special interest groups), IRC<br/>
(chat) and other features of CFN were internal, for CFN users only.</p>

<p>CFN was wildly popular in Cleveland and also had users from all over the US and<br/>
the world. It was typical to make dozens of attempts to dial in with a modem<br/>
only to be met with busy signals. Telnet access was slightly more hospitable<br/>
(if you had Internet access already, that is), but even telnet would<br/>
occasionally fill up and you'd have to wait a while for an opening. Coupled<br/>
with the one hour limit on logins, it could be a real bear to spend much time<br/>
on CFN. But users would login and relog religiously on the service, sessions<br/>
sometimes lasting for several hours.</p>

<pre><code>    This thing all things devours:
    Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
    Gnaws iron, bites steel;
    Grinds hard stones to meal;
    Slays king, ruins town,
    And beats high mountain down.

        "Riddles in the Dark"
        J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Hobbit"
</code></pre>

<p>As do all things, CFN fell victim to the slow decay of time. The years went by,<br/>
and the Internet, formerly the realm of academics and government, came to the<br/>
public's attention. The multimedia experience of the web and the increasing<br/>
availability of commercial Internet providers greatly reduced the appeal that<br/>
CFN had once held. For the first time, CFN started to lose users rather than<br/>
gain them.</p>

<p>Around this time, mid-1995, Raymond Neff of CWRU's Information Services office<br/>
posted <a href="/neff_letter.html">this open letter</a> to the Free-Net community.</p>

<p>In mid-1999, CWRU <a href="/end_announce.html">decided to discontinue</a>
the Cleveland Free-Net entirely. They<br/>
cited Y2K compliance problems; however, a lot of former CFN users believe that<br/>
was a convenient excuse (this author included). On September 30, 1999, it was<br/>
all over. The Cleveland Free-Net had closed its virtual doors forever.</p>
