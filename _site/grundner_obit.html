<p>By David Hayes</p>

<p>It was with sadness that I learned of the sudden death of Tom Grundner, author<br/>
and publisher, on Sunday 11th September 2011.</p>

<p>Tom was a great supporter of historic naval fiction both as an author of the<br/>
Sir Sidney Smith Nautical Adventure Series and as the Senior Editor of Fireship<br/>
Press. I have never met him face to face but I regarded him as a friend and I<br/>
had worked with to bring several new novels into publication. However to limit<br/>
Tom to this career is to do him an injustice as there was far more to him than<br/>
naval fiction.</p>

<p>Tom M. Grundner was born on 27 October 1945 in Clawson, Michigan (a small town<br/>
north of Detroit) and was educated at Clawson High School. He started his<br/>
university education at the Eastern Michigan University (EMU) where he received<br/>
his undergraduate degree in psychology. He was a record-breaking wide receiver<br/>
for EMU and played several seasons in the old Midwestern Professional Football<br/>
League for the Ann Arbor Vikings and later the Pontiac Firebirds. He earned a<br/>
masters degree in human learning from the Institute for Behavioral Research in<br/>
Silver Spring, Maryland, a second masters in education from the University of<br/>
Southern California and a doctorate in educational philosophy and psychology,<br/>
also from USC.</p>

<p>He served in the U.S. Navy rising to the rank of Lt. Commander. Among various<br/>
assignments, he served a tour in-country Vietnam (call sign "Buddha") doing<br/>
coastal surveillance and coordinating swift boat patrols in the II Corp region.<br/>
While there, he won the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat "V", the Vietnamese<br/>
Gallantry Cross with Palm, Vietnamese Civil Action Honor Medal, a Presidential<br/>
Unit Citation, a Combat Action Device, and "a bunch of other gee-dunk medals"<br/>
(as he called them). His time in the navy spawned an interest in the 18th<br/>
Century British Navy which would be a focus of his career in later life.</p>

<p>He spent the majority of his academic career as a college professor on the<br/>
faculty of Case Western Reserve University, School of Medicine, in Cleveland,<br/>
Ohio. While there, he participated in the development of some of the earliest<br/>
Internet applications. Indeed, many of the Internet services we now take for<br/>
granted have their origins in his pioneering pre-World Wide Web work. The<br/>
Cleveland Free-Net and the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN)<br/>
movement grew out of a 1984 research project conducted by Dr. Grundner, then<br/>
associated with the university's Department of Family Medicine.</p>

<p>He tested the applicability of delivering community health information with<br/>
a single telephone line in a system known as St. Silicon's Hospital, where<br/>
citizens could pose their questions to a board of public health experts and<br/>
receive answers within twenty-four hours. The popularity of the project<br/>
attracted financial support from AT&amp;T and the Ohio Bell Company, which funded<br/>
a larger project. Tom designed a full-scale CMC system as a community<br/>
information resource for fields far beyond public health alone. The governor<br/>
of Ohio opened Free-Net in July 1986 and the first phase of the experiment<br/>
attracted seven thousand registered users and more than five hundred calls<br/>
a day. In 1989, a new system opened, offering access via 48 telephone lines,<br/>
including a connection to Case Western Reserve University's fiber-optic<br/>
network and, eventually, Internet. Other local Free-Nets went online and in<br/>
1989, the participating organizations decided to create the NPTN and Dr<br/>
Grundner served as it's president.</p>

<p>Tom was one of the nation's first newspaper computer columnists, writing<br/>
a weekly column for the Cleveland Plain Dealer beginning in 1983, and for<br/>
several years he was a talk show host on radio station WERE in Cleveland. He<br/>
has received the Alumni Achievement Award from Eastern Michigan University,<br/>
the Award of Achievement in Education from Northern Ohio LIVE magazine, was<br/>
selected as an Outstanding Young Man of America by the U.S. Jaycees, and<br/>
selected as one of the "Eighty-four Most Interesting People in Cleveland" by<br/>
Cleveland Magazine.</p>

<p>In 1991 he left academia for a stint as the head of a non-profit organization,<br/>
then, in 1998, in an unusual career move he formed a for-profit company,<br/>
Marietta Golf Products making custom golf clubs. The success of this business<br/>
allowed him to devote himself increasingly to his "first love", writing,<br/>
becoming one the original investors in Fireship Press (he subsequently bought<br/>
out the others), and his experience as a clubmaker led him to write a series<br/>
of best-selling golf equipment books with noted golf club designer, Tom<br/>
Wishon. Search for the Perfect Driver (2006), The Search for the Perfect Golf<br/>
Club (2005), Ten Things You Thought You Knew About Golf Clubs (2008) and The<br/>
New Search for the Perfect Golf Club (2011).</p>

<p>In 1995, he was named by Newsweek magazine as one of the "50 Most Influential<br/>
People in Cyberspace"</p>

<p>His academic books have ranged from the ethics of human experimentation<br/>
(Informed Consent, 1986), to the problem of Internet porn (The Skinner Box<br/>
Effect, 2000).</p>

<p>In 2006 he published an edited history of the 18th Century Royal Navy (adapted<br/>
from Geoffrey Callender's Sea Kings of Britain 1907) called: The Men Who Spoke<br/>
to Hornblower and in 2007 The Ramage Companion, a companion book to the 18<br/>
volume series of historical novels by the British author, Dudley Pope.</p>

<p>At the time of his death he was serving as the "Senior Editor" of Fireship<br/>
Press, based in Tucson, Arizona, and working on his current major project,<br/>
a series of novels based on the real-life exploits of Sir Sidney Smith. Book<br/>
four, Acre, of what he intended to be a nine volume series, was published in<br/>
June this year.</p>

<p>As he told me in a recent interview the best part was the author's he'd been<br/>
able to "discover" and bring to market such as Alaric Bond, Linda Collison and<br/>
Steven E. Maffeo.</p>

<p>I understand it was Tom's wish that Fireship Press would continue and his<br/>
family and staff will be doing everything possible to continue the tradition<br/>
of this noble legacy.</p>

<p>He will be greatly missed by all fans of the genre and our thoughts are with<br/>
his family and colleagues.</p>

<p>Rest in Peace.</p>
