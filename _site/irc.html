&lt;&lt;&lt; INTERNET RELAY CHAT (IRC) &gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>While CFN offered a lot of services, the one I spent the most time using<br/>
was the IRC chat server. At one point I was the Sig Op for the IRC SIG<br/>
(special interest group).</p>

<p>CFN offered two separate IRC servers. One was exclusively for use by CWRU<br/>
faculty, staff and students. That server was connected to the primary IRC<br/>
network on the Internet at that time, EFnet. The other was for use by<br/>
non-CWRU users (the public) and was an unlinked server, meaning CFN users<br/>
could only talk to one another on IRC.</p>

<p>While some will say that this was a limitation, I never really saw it that<br/>
way (or, at least, I don't now). Because the people you were talking to were<br/>
all CFN users, and primarily right here in the Cleveland area, there was a<br/>
strong sense of community there. Many of us came out from time to time to<br/>
go to picnics, usually held in one or another park in Clevelands Metroparks<br/>
system. As the years wore on, the picnics were more and more sparsely<br/>
populated and eventually they stopped altogether.</p>

<p>These days, all that really remains of the CFN IRC community is a<br/>
<a href="/gallery">photo gallery</a> and an <a href="/list.html">email list</a>.</p>
