<pre>You know, I'm not really sure how I'm remembered on CFN, but I'd
probably say brash, young, cocky, and aggressive would be some good
ones.  Don't worry, I haven't changed.  :)

After I graduted high school in 1996, I went to Ashland University for
a semester (I played football there and absolutely hated it, so I
transferred).  I ended up at Baldwin-Wallace for about 3 quarters,
never went to class, and received GPAs (in order) of 4.0, 0.3, and
0.0.  They didn't like those last two, so they booted me.  I had a few
dead end jobs in the next few months and I ended up enlisting in the
Army.  When I was in the Army, I put in an application to go to West
Point and for some unknown reason, they overlooked the fact that I had
flunked out of college and accepted me (see the Miscellaneous pics..
those are pics of me at West Point).  I graduted from there in 2003
with a degree in Computer Science and a commission in the Army as a
Medical Service Corps officer (don't ask -- I don't even know what I
do from day to day).

I got stationed in Hawaii, which is pretty nice.  I was there from
October 2003 through April 2004.  In April 2004, my unit deployed to
Afganistan and I've been there since then.  We're palnning to head
back to Hawaii in April of this year.  I'm looking forward to that as
you can imagine.

Right now, I don't know what I'm planning on doing.  I'm looking into
going to the Army's physical therapy school.  I don't plan on using my
undergrad degree for anything; I'm not really sure why I picked
computer science.  Perhaps it was some old fetish with CFN and IRC
that kept my flame burning.

Some of my fondest memories of CFN are the picnics, especially my
first. I'll always remember Dana telling me that she thought I was
some nerdy guy with glasses.  Thanks Dana.  You've scarred me for
life.  I'll always remember the time Ben Min pushed Roger into a rock
in Bay Village.  Another funny thing is if anyone remembers the French
brothers (Nate and Brian) from Brooklyn, when I was at Baldwin-Wallace
I was roommates with a kid from Brooklyn who was good friends with
them.  Small world, I reckon.  And how about the &quot;clique.&quot;  I remember
it being a HUGE deal getting invited to their channels -- it was like
some type of rite of passage.  Gotta love those formative teenage
years.

I'd be most interested in locating Bryan Cristina (Tracker), Meg
Morlocke (Sunshine), Sati, Highlandr, TrIxTeR, Shannon Blake (Shag?),
and who knows who else I've forgotten about.

I keep in regular contact with one, yes only one, former CFN'er,
turtle (not sure if anyone knows her, she was a dy account I think). 
I've emailed Jeff Garvas a few times, but nothing really to brag about
(I don't know why anyone would brag about talking to him anyway).

Dan, kudos to you on having those pictures of me from West Point.  I
vaguely remember you starting some type of list a little while ago and
maybe I gave them to you -- I really don't remember.

*** AdMiRaL has quit IRC. ([Yellow Snow]) 

Can anyone tell me the guy who always used to say [Yellow Snow] ?  I
can't remember who it was.

P.S. So when is the kegger ?  I've got 30 days of vacation to burn
this summer and you know I'd love to waste it on a trip to Squire's
Castle or Wallace Lake.
