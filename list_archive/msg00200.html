&gt; &gt; yeah, i was going through old stuff and trying to
&gt; &gt; get rid of things.  i've been trying to avoid
&gt; &gt; being a packrat like my mom.  anyways, i threw
&gt; &gt; out a ton of pics thinking &quot;oh, yeah this person
&gt; &gt; from irc, i'll never see them again.&quot;  even
&gt; &gt; michaele's picture (i'm sorry, it's true!)  i
&gt; &gt; know cindy rizi, ashlee mclaughlin, and sherrie
&gt; &gt; nyugen were in that bunch too.  damn damn damn.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; well, hell, i'm really glad to see we're all
&gt; &gt; getting back together again.  i still have some
&gt; &gt; lasting relationships with folks from irc
&gt; &gt; (amadeus who now lives out here and builds wheels
&gt; &gt; at the bike manufacturer i work for and rolvow
&gt; &gt; who still lives with his parents despite being
&gt; &gt; married, having travelled the world, and thinking
&gt; &gt; about crossing the atlantic on a tandem kayak)
&gt; &gt; and often find myself missing it.  instant
&gt; &gt; msg'ing doesn't cut it and no irc has the same
&gt; &gt; feel cfn did.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; can someone PLEASE e-mail
&gt; &gt; (roulez-libre@animail.net) me a list of the
&gt; &gt; people they need/want to get a hold of?  i know a
&gt; &gt; few of them on the last list i can take care of.
&gt; &gt; i was in contact with shannon blake (shag) a
&gt; &gt; while back.  i can probably find her again.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i really vote for a picnic but let's get the hell
&gt; &gt; out of cleveland.  i'm so glad i got out of that
&gt; &gt; cesspool it's not even funny!  oregon at least
&gt; &gt; starts with an o.  no, olklahoma doesn't count.
&gt; &gt; it's technically pronounced &quot;auh-kluh-homey.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; but all seriousness aside, let me catch you all up:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i am/was walter lapchynski or sasha i nyktos /
&gt; &gt; TriXteR, nyghtmeyr, silence, and a bunch of other
&gt; &gt; nicks i can't even keep track of / at128 or fv075
&gt; &gt; (both respective to my real name and my nomme de
&gt; &gt; plume).  i was the guy who (with a little help)
&gt; &gt; handcuffed sati and sat on top of her at a picnic
&gt; &gt; many moons ago.  HAHAH!!  god i can't believe i'm
&gt; &gt; remembering all this shit.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; my story goes a little like this:  i did nothing.
&gt; &gt; just acted like the usual freak i still am to
&gt; &gt; various degrees until rolvow came back from
&gt; &gt; europe and taunted me with good stories.  he made
&gt; &gt; me promise i'd go with him next time he went some
&gt; &gt; where.  and i did.  we went to san fran to see
&gt; &gt; crash worship (who is unfortunately defunkt but
&gt; &gt; we saw every year after the 1st time we saw them
&gt; &gt; because it was such a religious experience) and i
&gt; &gt; fell in love with the west coast.  he got the
&gt; &gt; idea of hiking the pacific crest trail and i came
&gt; &gt; along with.  we had some hiking partners (one of
&gt; &gt; which was his gf) who werent' experienced enuff
&gt; &gt; and so we ended up getting off.  we split ways
&gt; &gt; and i ended up going to portland oregon where my
&gt; &gt; wife was (we had met her along the way which is a
&gt; &gt; much longer story full of amazing coincidences)..
&gt; &gt; i spent some time homeless, we hooked up, went to
&gt; &gt; hawai'i where we bummed around on the beach for
&gt; &gt; months on end at punalu'u and got engaged in
&gt; &gt; manoa.  then we came back and settled on
&gt; &gt; eugene... until my dad offered me a free house in
&gt; &gt; cleveland (another long story) which we took but
&gt; &gt; living in slavic village was kinda lame.  i spent
&gt; &gt; some time starting school (i finally figured out
&gt; &gt; what i wanted to do among all the millions of
&gt; &gt; things i was interested in) by doing community
&gt; &gt; college whilst being a bike messenger downtown.
&gt; &gt; by now the bike addiction was rampant, so when we
&gt; &gt; returned (i dragged amadeus back who was the guy
&gt; &gt; who introduced me to being a messenger there) i
&gt; &gt; had to find a job around bikes.  i got lucky as a
&gt; &gt; bike manufacturer (www.bikefriday.com) was
&gt; &gt; hiring.  i've done a little bit of everything
&gt; &gt; here and built a shitload of bikes for myself.
&gt; &gt; we were even car free for a bit but our house
&gt; &gt; (yes we bought a little fixer uper that's now got
&gt; &gt; a brand new house on the property) is kinda too
&gt; &gt; far out for my wife and daughter.  so now we have
&gt; &gt; a little kia spectra.  i still ride my bike
&gt; &gt; everyday.  i'm two (this one and the next) terms
&gt; &gt; away from my bachelors in science.  should have
&gt; &gt; an honors degree and a dissertation to show for
&gt; &gt; it, specifically on a gene (dim-6) involved in
&gt; &gt; DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa (french
&gt; &gt; bread yeast).  then maybe a job, but prolly grad
&gt; &gt; school.  just visited UCLA and applied to a few
&gt; &gt; others in cali, hawaii, and uoregon (where i've
&gt; &gt; been doing all my gen science and bio studies
&gt; &gt; at).  so i dunno what the next step is, but i'm
&gt; &gt; having fun and loving life.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; phew.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i think that's it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; in other news, dan:  i can't believe you're
&gt; &gt; working for the feds.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; we need to get some more people on this list.
&gt; &gt; and we all need to hook up on irc again.  i
&gt; &gt; wonder if we can still manage to remember what
&gt; &gt; cliques we belong in. :)
