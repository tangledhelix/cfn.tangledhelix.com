&gt;Oh come on now Matt... if I didn't know you better, 
&gt;I'd accuse you of trolling. :)

Oh come on now Roger... I don't troll - I sign my 
name in red or blue acrylic spraypaint, depending
on my mood.

&gt;I can't begrudge you your overt cynicism, but it's 
&gt;not QUITE that bad-- it's not like we live in Texas.

We don't need to live in Texas, because Texas came to 
us. The Republican Machine arrived in Ohio, co-opted 
the Secretary of State, trashed the election, and now 
its Four More Wars. The gerrymanders are whetting 
their blades, ready to cement a legacy that doesn't 
merely restrain the power of the Democratic Party, but 
utterly subjugates it forever.

&gt;It's part of the ebb and flow.

I disagree. The empowerment of the fundamentalists via
political process and a sudden rush of tax dollars
(that's &quot;Faith-based Initiatives&quot; for those at home),
the domination of right-wing ideology and propaganda
via mass-media (taken a ride through AM radio lately?
Catch any of the government-sponsored VNR's on Fox 19?
Can you spot the journalist on the Executive PR payroll?)
and the continued pursuit of divisive politics (check
the party line votes on Senate Bill 256, also known as
&quot;The Bankruptcy Bill&quot; that cleared the senate last week)
indicate that bipartisanship is DEAD, BABY. Its all
ebb from now on. This country isn't swinging to the
right, it is careening wildly to the right at full
throttle. 

The corporate powerbrokers got this country by the short
and curlies, and they ain't letting go. You got your
tort &quot;reform,&quot; you got your bankruptcy &quot;reform,&quot; now
we're spinning up the rigs to drill ANWR, just as the 
EPA greenlights pumping mercury into the air-soil-water,
courtesy of the energy lobbyists.

And this is all just in Q1-05. 

Remember our Republican majority in the Statehouse? What sort
of legislation occupies their collective attention? Is it
that school funding has been ruled unconstitutional 3
times? Is it that Ohio consistently lags behind the nation
in job growth and tax revenue? Is it the flight of
manufacturing jobs by the thousands to elsewhere, followed
closely by our college grads? Is it the spiralling costs
of health care for an aging population, or education costs
for our displaced workers?

No, its a more-restrictive version of the Patriot Act, to
combat all the terrorists that have taken refuge in Ohio.
Before that it was an amendment to the State Constitution
banning gay marriage. Oh, and a tax cut. That's right!
Our schools and cities are cutting services to stem a flood
of red ink, and our state electoral body wants to cut taxes
because our tax code is bad for businesses.

&gt;Right now we're seeing the neocon
&gt;evolution of the Republican-ruled &quot;values&quot; eras of the 
&gt;50s and 80s... and unfortunately, the absurdity of what 
&gt;comes out of the neocon-figurehead-of-the-decade's 
&gt;mouth is far less polished than the
&gt;rhetoric of the past, but moderation will come.

I wish it were that easy, or that simple. It concerns me
greatly that moderation isn't on anyone's Wish List.
When Blackwell and Petro and Taft can conduct government
as they have this past two years, and get away so clean that
Blackwell and Petro are already jockeying for position in
the governor's race, I know its going to be such a long
ride back, we won't even remember the way anymore.

&gt;And history has taught us that is will have to get worse before 
&gt;it gets better.  

&quot;When peaceful revolution is made impossible, then violent
revolution is inevitable.&quot;

&gt;The populace must have causes to latch on to 
&gt;and believe in before they participate in the momentum swing.  

The populace is becoming irrelevant. The half with the money and
power is paving over the half without. The &quot;causes&quot; will be
mercury in the food chain, petroleum at $75 a barrel, a broken
healthcare system and public debt that will never be repaid.
Some causes, huh? Yeah, I see them just lining up around the
block for a shot at change. Right after &quot;American Idol.&quot;

But it won't matter because &quot;We'll all be dead by then.&quot;


&gt;We intellectuals just sit here playing armchair politician, 
&gt;as always.  Anybody with such idealism is innately unsuited for 
&gt;the part.

Uh, yeah, whatever. You hold the fort, I'll be marching, writing,
fund-raising, monitoring the legislation, voting and playing in 
the park when its sunny. It's difficult for me to find solace 
sitting on my ass.

And, when I &quot;disappear,&quot; you'll know why.

Re's,
MC
