title: IRC Community Email List

To join or leave the list, visit this page:

<http://lists.tangledhelix.com/listinfo.cgi/cfn-tangledhelix.com>

You can also view the current list's archives there, with your list password.  
If you don't know your list password, you can get the system to email it to  
you (from the same page). Just put your email address in the box at the  
bottom and click the button, and the next page will have a password reminder  
function.

The above doesn't have all the archives available. Some were erased when  
I switched the list from scsiboy.com to tangledhelix.com. I've posted the  
old archives here:

[(old) CFN List Archives](/list_archive)

Because of spam-bots trolling the web for addresses, you need to log into  
this page also. The username and password are both "archive".
