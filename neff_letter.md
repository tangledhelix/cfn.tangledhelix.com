Vice President for Information Services  
Case Western Reserve University

This summary has been prepared in response to inquiries concerning the  
Cleveland Freenet's efforts to serve the needs of its steadily increasing  
number of users. It is not intended as an exhaustive or even complete history  
of the Cleveland Free-Net.

Six Facts

1. The Cleveland Free-Net, developed at CWRU, is the pioneering initiative in  
free public computing.

2. Use of the Cleveland Free-Net has grown rapidly: in 1994 there were  
6 million user sessions.

3. CWRU has invested more than $300,000 in grants and other revenue to support  
and improve the Cleveland Free-Net, and continues to spend more than  
$50,000 annually to operate the system.

4. The Cleveland Free-Net has never charged a fee to a user, and it hopes  
never to do so.

5. The Cleveland Free-Net welcomes the arrival of commercial services, which  
have begun to provide features similar to those available to Cleveland  
Free-Net users for years.

6. The Cleveland Free-Net will remain an alternative to commercial services,  
thus supporting open communication in our communities.

Background

The Cleveland Free-Net was born in 1986 as a research project in the Department  
of Family Medicine at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine.  
Assistant Professor Thomas M. Grundner was the principal investigator on the  
project. As is standard operating procedure with university-based research  
projects, he had the responsibility to seek funding for his research. Dr.  
Grundner wrote proposals and eventually the University received funds and  
computing equipment from a variety of sources to assemble the hardware and  
software to create the Cleveland Free-Net. This fund raising effort raised  
$44,000 from Ohio Bell, and computing equipment worth $60,000 from AT&T.

The Cleveland Free-Net system had its operational debut in July 1986. By summer  
1988, the AT&T hardware was overloaded with use (it had an absolute limit of  
ten simultaneous users, but it regularly ran with a limit of nine). By this  
time, the system had 1,000 registered users.

During 1987-88, plans were implemented to create a more functional version of  
the Cleveland Free-Net software, to be dubbed Version 2. This project was  
undertaken outside of CWRU by the newly created Society for Public Access  
Computing (SoPAC). Dr. Grundner was the organization's first executive  
director. SoPAC engaged a computer programmer and paid $10,000 to accomplish  
this objective, using funds from a grant to SoPAC for this purpose. By summer  
1989, no useful software had been developed, and the project was formally  
abandoned.

Because CWRU attached great importance to the evolution of the Cleveland  
Free-Net, it was decided that the University's newly created Office of  
Information Services should be the home base for the Cleveland Free-Net. The  
University Vice President for Information Services, Dr. Raymond K. Neff, took  
on the overall responsibility for the operation and development of the  
Cleveland Free-Net. As of July 1, 1989, Dr. Grundner and his staff of one  
full-time support person became employees of CWRU's Office of Information  
Services. The University took on the following objectives for improving the  
system:

1. Stabilizing the operation of the Cleveland Free-Net (during this period,  
the computer hardware and modems had not had regular maintenance for over a  
year and were unreliable).

2. Purchasing a computer which had the capacity to handle sixty simultaneous  
users (the AT&T computer was overloaded).

3. Adding more incoming telephone lines.

4. Creating the needed Version 2 Cleveland Free-Net software.

5. Putting a full complement of computer professionals into the operation  
and maintenance of the system (providing operational support to the system  
and its users 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 365 days per year -  
which is the same basis as the University's mainframe computers).

6. Adding more services to the Cleveland Free-Net, most notably access to  
the Internet and its vast array of information resources.

By any measure, this program of improvements was a dramatic and substantial  
commitment on the part of Case Western Reserve University to the still  
experimental concept of free public computing.

Accomplishments

On August 16, 1989, the CWRU-developed version of the Cleveland Free-Net,  
Version 2 went into public use. The six major objectives had been substantially  
accomplished. The new Version 2, now registered by CWRU under the trademark  
FreePort, had much more functionality than was called for in the design for the  
earlier SoPAC-sponsored Version 2. This new system was based on new IBM  
hardware which was far more powerful and reliable and had much more capacity  
than the older AT&T system. Twenty-four modems were added to the system,  
bringing the total capacity in terms of number of simultaneous dial-in users  
to 34.

Usage statistics took off. Within a few months, we had added 10,000 registered  
users. That early pace has hardly slackened: as of this report, the number of  
registered users exceeds 160,000. The operational usage statistics show  
absolutely stunning growth factors when usage for calendar year 1994 is  
compared to 1988: from 160 to 16,000 individual users on any given day; 36,000  
to nearly 6 million user sessions per year (averaging 28 minutes each); and  
sustained growth rates of over 10% per month!

FreePort was the first version of the Cleveland Free-Net software to be based  
on a scalable architecture for hardware and software, whereas Cleveland  
Free-Net Version 1 had definite limitations on growth. By its very design,  
FreePort could grow to handle thousands of simultaneous users, as might be  
envisioned in providing "commercial-grade" public access computing. In fact,  
the original target for FreePort was 600 simultaneous users, clearly in another  
ballpark from Cleveland Free-Net Version 1. Today, the Cleveland system  
actually supports 406 simultaneous users, including connections through all  
types of Internet service providers and 260 dial-in telephone lines.

The FreePort software and the know-how associated with this novel form of  
computing were soon offered to other communities who wanted to emulate the  
success of the Cleveland Free-Net. CWRU has helped over a dozen other cities  
start clones of the Cleveland Free-Net. A grant of the FreePort software and an  
IBM computer were given by CWRU to Medina County to start the Medina Free-Net.  
This missionary work looked so promising in early 1990 that Dr. Grundner  
started the National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) as a project within  
the Office for Information Services at CWRU, and after two years left CWRU to  
devote full time to this concept. (NPTN has always been a separately  
incorporated, not-for-profit entity.) To date, over 70 clones of the  
Version 2 Cleveland Free-Net have been started.

Funding the Cleveland Free-Net Service

To anyone looking at the Cleveland Free-Net from a financial point-of-view, the  
service has seemed somewhat magical. How can one offer millions of hours of  
computer access time per year to thousands of people without charging them?

We have said for years that the service is free to its users, but there are  
substantial costs in creating and operating the Cleveland Free-Net. Yes, the  
Cleveland Free-Net is absolute free of charges to its end users, but the annual  
costs of operating the Cleveland Free-Net are in the neighborhood of $50,000.  
Without any external source of support for the system, these costs have fallen  
on Case Western Reserve University. It is still true that, during the its  
entire nine-year life, the Cleveland Free-Net has never charged a single user  
for its service.

One of the possible funding models for the Cleveland Free-Net is public  
broadcasting, i.e., we could use the fund-raising approach used very  
successfully by PBS stations nationwide. After studying what is involved in  
using this model, the University found that it did not have the in-house  
expertise to carry out this approach. Over the years a few Cleveland Free-Net  
users have said that they would volunteer to help raise funds for the Cleveland  
Free-Net, but there have never been enough people to make the effort feasible  
- although we deeply appreciate the sincerity and interest that these  
volunteers showed in coming forward. A few other users have voluntarily sent  
money to the University, but this source has never amounted to more than $1,000  
per year.

Another possible funding model is the one used by public libraries. Our  
excellent public library systems in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County do not charge  
users for the general services they provide. They are funded in part with  
a portion of the property taxes levied in the region, and they also receive  
a share of a State of Ohio appropriation. Public access computing as practiced  
by the Cleveland Free-Net is similar to the libraries' practice of making  
general information resources available without charge, and it is interesting  
that the Cleveland Free-Net model has been widely accepted by the community of  
librarians. Perhaps the method that funds these libraries could be adapted to  
cover the Cleveland Free-Net. On the other hand, it should be noted that there  
have been several levies on area ballots in the past nine years to support  
public libraries, and it is not clear that the voters would be in favor of  
additional tax payments to support public access computing.

Over the past five years, the University has raised some $60,000, however, by  
licensing the FreePort software to other communities to start clones of the  
Cleveland Free-Net. All of these funds have been used to add more hardware to  
the system, especially modems. Even so, growth in usage continues to outstrip  
our best efforts.

One of the ways to offer free services is to control expenses. We have polished  
our skills in this respect over the past seven years. In particular, the  
hardware manufacturers have continued to give the University deep discounts on  
their products, and this is very much appreciated. Even so, the University has  
had to spend over $150,000 for computer hardware to implement three generations  
of system upgrades, including the present Cleveland Free-Net service, which  
involves 18 interconnected microcomputers (16 Intel Pentiums and 486s and two  
Sun SparcServers), all running UNIX. Several thoughtful Cleveland Free-Net  
users have made donations of used modems to the University, and these were put  
into service. As one might expect with such equipment, it did not have a long  
life, and the University eventually had to buy hundreds of replacement modems.  
When we did make these purchases, we were careful to acquire "smart" modems  
which provided superior reliability, very high speed (from 14400 baud to 38400  
baud), and "intelligent" management. These modems were relatively expensive,  
but they have been true workhorses.

From our usage statistics, we see that the Cleveland Free-Net modems are in use  
over 99% of all available time (over 700 hours per month each). It is no  
exaggeration to say that we could use double or even triple the number we  
presently have. Lack of funding has been the principal limitation to continued  
expansion of the Cleveland Free-Net.

It is remarkable that the Cleveland Free-Net service now costs the University  
under one penny per user session. Use of the public telephone system to connect  
to the Cleveland Free-Net involves costs which add up to about four cents per  
user session. Thus the total cost per user session when a telephone and modem  
are used is now about five cents.

Connecting to the Cleveland Free-Net by way of the Internet is another  
alternative, however. We started offering this approach in 1989, and now over  
50% of all usage comes through this path. The cost of this linkage is less than  
one tenth of a penny per session, so the lesson is clear: connecting to the  
Cleveland Free-Net via the Internet is the most cost-effective method.

It is worth spending a moment to put these cost figures into perspective. If  
the average Cleveland Free-Net user has two sessions per day via an Internet  
connection, then our cost is $0.022. If the user does this every day for  
a month, then the cost is $0.66 per month, the cost of two first class postage  
stamps. On an annual basis, the cost is under $8.00. Given the costs to prepare  
and send out invoices, we could not afford to bill our users for this service  
- even if we wished to do so.

Looking Ahead

The Cleveland Free-Net represents a pioneering effort to provide free public  
computing for this community and others nationally and internationally.  
Commercial services, with access to risk capital and to fee income from large  
numbers of corporate and individual users, are beginning to offer many of the  
features that have been available to Free-Net users for years. The Cleveland  
Free-Net does not plan to compete with these commercial services, but rather to  
continue to offer no-fee public computing as an alternative for those who  
cannot or choose not to become customers of commercial services, as well as for  
users who choose to gain access to Free-Net through connections provided by  
other services. In this respect, the Cleveland Free-Net preserves the  
distinctly American tradition of open communication in a new era of information  
technology.
