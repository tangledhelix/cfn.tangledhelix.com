Once upon a time, there was a girl named Jennifer. She was rumored to have been  
six months old before she even came into existence, and for this reason, all  
the people of the land were jealous of her because she was therefore a magical  
person. The King (who was single!) took notice of her one day, and was inspired  
by this magical creature, which lived in his kingdom, so he gave unto her the  
most special gift a king in that land might give, which was a jellybean. Not  
just any jellybean. A wishing jellybean!  She could rub the jellybean, and  
a little bean-genie would come out, and grant her one wish, provided she ate  
the jellybean afterward and set him free. For so long as the jellybean existed  
he was forever its prisoner, and it gets awfully cramped up in a jellybean for  
someone as big as a genie (especially a bean-genie, who were rather large, as  
genies go), so she kept the genie-bean in her pillow until she could think of  
a wish special enough to use it for. But she was yet a young girl, and prone to  
distraction, and soon forgot the jellybean in favor of a young man named  
Michael, who caught her eye one day. The poor little bean-genie grew anxious as  
he realized he might well spend years more locked in his jellybean prison  
whilst this girl went about her dalliances with Michael, and he grew sad, but  
it was only a handful of years, the genie was relieved to see (for what is such  
a short time to a bean-genie?) before she came to her pillow one day and  
reached in to grasp his little world and rub upon its sides and as he came  
forth, she asked of him to make her into the most beautiful woman in all the  
world, so that Michael would wish to marry her. The genie chuckled inwardly,  
and in a minute, I'm sure you'll see why. For he waved forth his great arm and  
a ray of light fell upon her and a moment later, the genie tossed the jellybean  
in her mouth, and she dutifully chewed it up, and swallowed it, setting the  
genie free. Almost as an afterthought she walked to a mirror, only to see the  
same face she had seen every day for years on end. She angrily turned to the  
genie and demaded to know what the meaning of this was, when he chuckled  
\*outwardly\* this time he said unto her:

"Silly girl, you asked of me to make you into that which you already are! You  
are a magic creature, and really, there wasn't much I could improve
on."

She blushed, and the genie went on a vacation in Tahiti. The moral of the story  
is: only wish for things you don't already have. Genies are tricky.
