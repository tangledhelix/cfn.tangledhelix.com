title: The End of CFN
---

In mid-1999, CWRU decided to discontinue the Cleveland Free-Net entirely.  
This notice was posted to announce the impending shutdown.

	--------------------------------------------------

The Cleveland Free-Net, a remarkable achievement for its time, has been  
made obsolete by new technologies. Chat and News services for community  
users will end on September 1, 1999. The Free-Net will be discontinued on  
September 30, 1999.

CWRU faculty, staff, and students should immediately investigate the services  
provided by CWRUnet; information is available at Information Services Help  
Desk (KSL 105A), via e-mail to help@po.cwru.edu, and on the World Wide Web  
at www.cwru.edu/net/nutshell/miscl/free-cwru.html.

CWRU alumni should visit the Alumni Affairs World Wide Web site for  
information about the CWRUser program at www.cwru.edu/development/alum2/.  
That site gives an overview of the program, which is not an ISP but a way  
to enhance alumni access to CWRU.

Community users of Free-Net should explore alternate ways of receiving e-mail  
and using Internet resources. Public libraries, various continuing education  
programs, city recreation boards, and community users' groups are excellent  
sources of information.

After September 30, 1999, users who attempted to log in were greeted with  
this message:

"The Cleveland Freenet has discontinued operation. The project has  
concluded. Thank you for your participation."
